# ZrC FM

## Overview
This project is a website that acts as a form of 'Radio'. It features music, personally developed, of various genres, represented as 'stations'. In building this website, I'm expecting to learn about working with audio on the web but also using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It should make a good learning experience and an interesting project.
